# Vim-TODO-Highlighter

This project was written to make my TODO lists easier to read by adding color coding.

The coloring is dependent on the type of bullet used to prefix a task.

\- This results in WHITE text \
\> This results in YELLOW text \
\>> This results in ORANGE text \
\>>> This results in RED text \
\>>>> This results in RED text with a WHITE background \
